					<h4><b> Treatment : </b> </h4>
                    <h6>

					There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected. As a result, every effort should be made to prevent the disease from entering your garden.
					<br>
1.Fungicides will NOT treat this viral disease.
<br>
2.Plant resistant varieties when available or purchase transplants from a reputable source.
<br>
3.Do NOT save seed from infected crops.
<br>
4.Spot treat with least-toxic, natural pest control products, such as Safer Soap, Bon-Neem and diatomaceous earth, to reduce the number of disease carrying insects.
<br>
5.Harvest-Guard® row cover will help keep insect pests off vulnerable crops/ transplants and should be installed until bloom.
<br>
6.Remove all perennial weeds, using least-toxic herbicides, within 100 yards of your garden plot.
<br>
7.The virus can be spread through human activity, tools and equipment. Frequently wash your hands and disinfect garden tools, stakes, ties, pots, greenhouse benches, etc. (one part bleach to 4 parts water) to reduce the risk of contamination.
<br>
8.Avoid working in the garden during damp conditions (viruses are easily spread when plants are wet).
<br>
9.Avoid using tobacco around susceptible plants. Cigarettes and other tobacco products may be infected and can spread the virus.
<br>
10.Remove and destroy all infected plants (see Fall Garden Cleanup). Do NOT compost.
